# People Counter

## Description

A small app that allows the user to log the number of people that they count at a time.

In building and deploying this app, I learnt about the learning platform [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/), how to connect HTML with JavaScript, and deploying apps with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Specifically, I learnt about "The DOM" (Document Object Model), that is, how to use JavaScript to change the website, e.g. using`getElementById()` and the `.innerText` and `.textContent` properties.

## Usage

The app can be accessed and used through a web browser at the address below.

Clicking on the 'increment' button will increment the counter by 1, and then clicking on the 'save' button will log the counter number below and also reset the counter.

A screenshot of how the app should look on a suitably sized screen is shown below.
