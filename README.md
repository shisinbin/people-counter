# People Counter

## Description

A small app that allows the user to log the number of people that they count at a time.

In building and deploying this app, I learnt about the learning platform Scrimba, how to connect HTML with JavaScript, and deploying apps with Netlify.

## Usage

Clicking on the 'increment' button will increment the counter by 1, and then clicking on the 'save' button will log the counter number below and also reset the counter.
